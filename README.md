# Ruby Testing and Software Spec

This repository contains a series of exercises I used to practice writing clean and functional test cases in Ruby.
The exercises use 4 major ruby testing libraries including minitest, rspec, and cucumber. 
All code satisfies Reek code quality checks.

The commits in this repository are written using a learning method where you reflect what you have completed in the past 30 minutes of programming.
Therefore, they are not "Good Commits" and do not reflect how I would normally structure my commits.
