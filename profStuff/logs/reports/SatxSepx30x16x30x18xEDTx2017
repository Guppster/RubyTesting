    Installed Ruby and setup Bitbucket to be able to pull from repo.
    Spent a few minutes looking into rbenv and rvm but decided to just
    install Ruby directly from my package manager instead.

    any problems.

    Starting this task I began looking for the countdown file that
    was specified in the r001_description. I was unable to find the file in
    the folder specified so I asked a classmate for the location. After
    retrieving the hidden file from the bin directory I installed the
    minitest gem, made countdown into a method and began writing a test for
    the method.

    Solves step one. One challenge I ran into was that the assertion was
    failing because the recorded time was slighty larger than 120 seconds
    and i solved this by rounding the result

    Finished steps two and three. Used reek to repair all the code
    smells. I struggled to come up with variable names that reek found
    acceptable but eventually found some.

    Finished step 4 and 5 by implementing QuietPrintMethod and fixing code smells.
    Looked up how to make interfaces in Ruby because there should be one
    describing QuietPrintMethod and PrintMethod because they both
    provide print functionality but to my surprise ruby
    doesn't even support interfaces.

    Finished functional part of step 6. Still need to correct reek results.
    Experimented with different ways of obtaining duration in
    QuietPrintMethod and found a clean way that works. I am finding instance
    varible notation in Ruby very confusing. '@' is annoying.

    Fixed code smells but one about the camel case varible names still
    exists because the instructions also use a camel case name for the
    timeInterval method. Found and fixed a bug with the duration counting
    part of quietprinter
