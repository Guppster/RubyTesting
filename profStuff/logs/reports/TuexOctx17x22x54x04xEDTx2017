    Installed Ruby and setup Bitbucket to be able to pull from repo.
    Spent a few minutes looking into rbenv and rvm but decided to just
    install Ruby directly from my package manager instead.

    any problems.

    Starting this task I began looking for the countdown file that
    was specified in the r001_description. I was unable to find the file in
    the folder specified so I asked a classmate for the location. After
    retrieving the hidden file from the bin directory I installed the
    minitest gem, made countdown into a method and began writing a test for
    the method.

    Solves step one. One challenge I ran into was that the assertion was
    failing because the recorded time was slighty larger than 120 seconds
    and i solved this by rounding the result

    Finished steps two and three. Used reek to repair all the code
    smells. I struggled to come up with variable names that reek found
    acceptable but eventually found some.

    Finished step 4 and 5 by implementing QuietPrintMethod and fixing code smells.
    Looked up how to make interfaces in Ruby because there should be one
    describing QuietPrintMethod and PrintMethod because they both
    provide print functionality but to my surprise ruby
    doesn't even support interfaces.

    Finished functional part of step 6. Still need to correct reek results.
    Experimented with different ways of obtaining duration in
    QuietPrintMethod and found a clean way that works. I am finding instance
    varible notation in Ruby very confusing. '@' is annoying.

    Fixed code smells but one about the camel case varible names still
    exists because the instructions also use a camel case name for the
    timeInterval method. Found and fixed a bug with the duration counting
    part of quietprinter

    I am at 2 errors. Working on undefined method total.
    Figured out how to create a constructor and a constant to eliminate two
    previous errors.

    Still have two failures from unimplemented total and sale but I have now
    created the object structures required to support the functionality they
    need. I created a Store class that contains an array of Item objects
    each with a discount struct.

    Learned about the inject functionality on objects and tried using that
    to sum up my items in receipt but ran into the issue of not knowing
    how many of each item i have sold Therefore had to change the receipt
    into an Hash. Learned more about Structs and used one to make Discount
    object with an evaluate function

    Currently at 2 failures 0 errors. Figured out how to evaluate deals
    based on item and how to calculate final price. Still having issues with
    2 tests both use AAA as receipt. Its an edge case error that should be
    easy to solve

    All test cases passing. Had to inverse discount numbers to get the
    correct value for subtracting from the original cost. Spent some time
    satisfying all reek requirements

    Solved the first test by using an nil check.
    9 failures remain.
    Planned out how to code the justify method

    Found a way to split words, and find the exact number of spaces needed
    in between words for the justify_line method. Currently challenged with
    placing the remainder amount of spaces into the correct positon.
    
    9 failures no errors and code smells still exist

    on justify(). 4 failures and 0 errors. Code smells still remain to be
    fixed
