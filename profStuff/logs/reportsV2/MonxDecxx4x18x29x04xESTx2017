    Installed Ruby and setup Bitbucket to be able to pull from repo.
    Spent a few minutes looking into rbenv and rvm but decided to just
    install Ruby directly from my package manager instead.

    Starting this task I began looking for the countdown file that
    was specified in the r001_description. I was unable to find the file in
    the folder specified so I asked a classmate for the location. After
    retrieving the hidden file from the bin directory I installed the
    minitest gem, made countdown into a method and began writing a test for
    the method.

    Finished step 4 and 5 by implementing QuietPrintMethod and fixing code smells.
    Looked up how to make interfaces in Ruby because there should be one
    describing QuietPrintMethod and PrintMethod because they both
    provide print functionality but to my surprise ruby
    doesn't even support interfaces.

    Experimented with different ways of obtaining duration in
    QuietPrintMethod and found a clean way that works. I am finding instance
    varible notation in Ruby very confusing. '@' is annoying.

    When i fixed all the reek issues a lot of rspec tests started failing. This was due to some of the code i had renamed and moved around. I resolved all the issues and got the rspec tests running again. I also had to change some varaible names in the spec file because they were referencing variables directly and those variables had improper naming, so i also had to rename them in the spec file. Next i fixed one of the deprecation warnings by removing a line from the spec_helper file.

    In this iteration I downloaded the files and arranged them in the rspec format (spec directory). Then i had to create a spec_helper and require it in the spec test class.

    break is inside insertion_sort and this will allow me to continue fixing
    mutation bugs and discover the problem inside insertion_sort method.
    Used the checklist method.

    of this the mutation test is still freezing for me when all methods are
    uncommented and there does not seem to be many resources troubleshooting

    this but i broke one of my test cases. When the array to sort is big,
    the sort is not correct. I ran out of time but next time i will fix this

    Set up file structure and GemFiles to support simplecov, mutant, and rspec development environment.
    Had issues setting up mutant but recalled notes i recorded from r007 and fixed the issues using them.

    Next thing on checklist is convert minitest to rspec. This commit starts
    and finishes that task. Had to look at rspec documentation to learn
    about how to use the before block in the specification. I needed to use
    it to create a new nim instance for each test. It replaces the setup
    method in the minitest version of the testing file

    Started Step 3 on the checklist. Generated a coverage statistic and as
    the instructions described, not much was covered by the tests. Next I
    researched using the provided links about how to test I/O and began
    writing an example game with I/O handling. I used the NimPlayerTesting
    script that was included in the project repo to base my test off of.
    Test is not complete at this time but is in good progress. Also fixed
    reek errors in all code provided including the NimPlayerTesting script

    Still working on Step 3. Have improved coverage and learned a lot more
    about testing I/O. Did more reading on the links provided and started
    improving a fakeIO class i found online to serve as a helper for my IO
    testing. Started by testing the start_game method in nim with it's intro
    output messages

    Finished Step 3. Got input and output testing working. Improved coverage
    by including stdout output lines. Had to write some more additions to
    the fakeIO class to get everything working. Learned about ruby shortcuts
    like %w() for returning a word array. Learned ruby doesnt support
    overloading methods. Now moving on to step 4 on checklist, achieving
    higher coverage

    copied into it the file the prof provided. Next step on checklist is
    created step definitions.

    feature for GCD. Handled inputs correctly following webpage
    instructions. Now i need to write the steps

    Using the checklist mechanism in this block of time i improved the
    coverage of the test suite by another 10 percent. I have continued
    making use of my FakeIO class and tested input and output for the
    humanMakeMove method. Currently i am attempting to traverse the program
    in another order using IO testing to cover more lines

    Using the checklist mechanism i targetting the next biggest methods of
    code that were not covered by the tests. These were the autoPlay methods
    including computer_player_smart, computer_player_dumb, and
    autoComputerMakeMove. Therefore, I ran a simulated game in the test and
    checked return values from the getters. Using this I was able to get to
    80% coverage with my current test suite. This is another 10% improvement
    from my last update

    Next thing in my checklist was covering the display method and the few
    remaining program flows that hadn't been traversed. In this time block i
    mananged to do that and achive near full coverage. I am at 90% with all
    IO tested and all logic tested. The remaining 10% is the __FILE__ method
    which is only executed when the script is run directly therefore it is
    not easily testable. Since that method is just running other methods
    (which are tested) in order, it does not have a big impact.

    In this time slot I fixed my feature file. I discovered i initially
    copied the feature file from the sample directory incorrectly and
    therefore i was always seeing cucumber produce 0 scenarios 0 steps as
    output. To fix this I copied over the sample again and looked up the
    correct format. From this I was able to get cucumber running

    In this time segment i learned how to include my code file (gcd.rb) in
    my step definitions by making use of the env.rb in the support
    directory. Then i learned how to pipe the output of one step definition
    into the input of another which can be done by making use of instance
    variables. In the process of learning this I have completed all step
    definitions and finished Step 3.

    Completed step 3 by requireing the prime factors file in the env.rb,
    then writing steps for each of the actions. The stackoverflow link
    provided in the instructions was useful for converting the input.
    All tests pass now
