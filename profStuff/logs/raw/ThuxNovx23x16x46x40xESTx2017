    writing an example game with I/O handling. I used the NimPlayerTesting

    In order to eliminiate the last line that was causing alive mutations i
    decided to try and optimaze the choose_pivot method by rewriting it in a
    more explicit way. I did reduce my alive mutations to only 3 by doing
    this but i broke one of my test cases. When the array to sort is big,
    the sort is not correct. I ran out of time but next time i will fix this
    test case and then have almost no alive mutations

    Using the checklist method I went back to the task of achieving 100%
    coverage. I made a new test case for the pivot method and with the
    refactored code (for reek) I was able to get 100% coverage. Regardless
    of this the mutation test is still freezing for me when all methods are
    uncommented and there does not seem to be many resources troubleshooting
    this issue online. I am now going to proceed with asking another student
    if they encountered this problem to not waste any more time.

    Fixed all Reek issues. Found a solution to my problem with
    insertion_sort method causing mutation testing to freeze. Worked around
    it by commenting out insertion_sort and passing it's arguments to
    quicksort. This shows me that the problem causing mutation testing to
    break is inside insertion_sort and this will allow me to continue fixing
    mutation bugs and discover the problem inside insertion_sort method.
    Used the checklist method.

    mutation testing halting on the insertionSort method and never moving
    forward. The mutation test reads 124/175 and never progresses. Currently
    researching why this may be happening and looking for a fix.

    When i fixed all the reek issues a lot of rspec tests started failing. This was due to some of the code i had renamed and moved around. I resolved all the issues and got the rspec tests running again. I also had to change some varaible names in the spec file because they were referencing variables directly and those variables had improper naming, so i also had to rename them in the spec file. Next i fixed one of the deprecation warnings by removing a line from the spec_helper file.

    I fixed the rspec problems, read the blog post and setup simplecov.
    Then i began fixing reek problems.  Simplecov successfully found out
    the coverage of the testing.

    Finally got reek to accept my r003 code. I learned how to split up ruby code in chunks of 3 lines
    and how to avoid feature envy by putting data into instance variables. (Even though we don't create an instance of this class).
    Currently at 5 failures 0 errors.

    Solved all but one code smell. Feature envy is a major problem in this
    code problem because these are both utility functions without a class.
    The tests should be changed to make a JustificationUtility and then
    utilize it so we can make use of instance variables and avoid
    referencing self more than the parameter variables. The result of
    "fixing" the code smells to make reek happy in this problem actually
    resulted in some very badly styled programming.

    9 failures no errors and code smells still exist

    Learned about the inject functionality on objects and tried using that
    to sum up my items in receipt but ran into the issue of not knowing

    into an Hash. Learned more about Structs and used one to make Discount
    object with an evaluate function

    retrieving the hidden file from the bin directory I installed the
    minitest gem, made countdown into a method and began writing a test for
    the method.
