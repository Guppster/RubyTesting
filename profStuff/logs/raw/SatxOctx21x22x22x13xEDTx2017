    I fixed the rspec problems, read the blog post and setup simplecov.
    Then i began fixing reek problems.  Simplecov successfully found out
    the coverage of the testing.

    Finally got reek to accept my r003 code. I learned how to split up ruby code in chunks of 3 lines
    and how to avoid feature envy by putting data into instance variables. (Even though we don't create an instance of this class).
    Currently at 5 failures 0 errors.

    Solved all but one code smell. Feature envy is a major problem in this
    code problem because these are both utility functions without a class.
    The tests should be changed to make a JustificationUtility and then
    utilize it so we can make use of instance variables and avoid
    referencing self more than the parameter variables. The result of
    "fixing" the code smells to make reek happy in this problem actually
    resulted in some very badly styled programming.

    was specified in the r001_description. I was unable to find the file in
    the folder specified so I asked a classmate for the location. After
    retrieving the hidden file from the bin directory I installed the
    minitest gem, made countdown into a method and began writing a test for
    the method.
