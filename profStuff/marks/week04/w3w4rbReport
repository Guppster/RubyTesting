>     Learned about the expect keyword and how to use it. Reverted an edit i made to the test files in my last commit and got them to work without having to edit the require statements. Learned about the .rspec config file in the root of the project. 24 failures right now using the new expect syntax, currently learning how to do comparisons with this syntax

>     Learned the way to do comparisons with new expect syntax and fixed all errors in tests. 0 failures and 0 errors in the tests now.
>     Then used the coverage report to find the line that was not being covered inside the game.rb file and wrote a test to cover when player2 wins thegame. Achieved 100% code coverage

>     These all fixed all but one reek issue. Next is finding out how to avoid a nil check in game.rb.

>     When i fixed all the reek issues a lot of rspec tests started failing. This was due to some of the code i had renamed and moved around. I resolved all the issues and got the rspec tests running again. I also had to change some varaible names in the spec file because they were referencing variables directly and those variables had improper naming, so i also had to rename them in the spec file. Next i fixed one of the deprecation warnings by removing a line from the spec_helper file.

>     In this iteration I downloaded the files and arranged them in the rspec format (spec directory). Then i had to create a spec_helper and require it in the spec test class. I also had to create a .rspec config file in the root of the project. Then in the spec_helper I enabled simple_cov and finally generated a coverage report as well as passing tests.

>     Fixed many reek issues. Discovered I could make grid an instance varaible and remove a method parameter which reduced a lot of reek errors. Kept tests passing. 12 reek errors remain
