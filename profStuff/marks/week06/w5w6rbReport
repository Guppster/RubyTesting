>     Lots of progress on Step 4. I had to go back and follow the slideshow
>     here https://github.com/DonSchado/colognerb-on-mutant/blob/master/mutation_testing_slides.pdf
>     which is one of the links on the class wiki and using this information i

>     valuable results. Now I have mutant showing 97% coverage and most
>     mutations being "killed". It is showing a mutation and now i will
>     attempt to fix it
