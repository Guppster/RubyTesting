>     Continuting to improve results from mutation testing. Fixed an issue
>     with simplecov not being in one of my GemFiles which was causing all
>     mutations to have the same problem. Just ran into an issue with
>     mutation testing halting on the insertionSort method and never moving
>     forward. The mutation test reads 124/175 and never progresses. Currently
>     researching why this may be happening and looking for a fix.

>     Fixed all Reek issues. Found a solution to my problem with
>     insertion_sort method causing mutation testing to freeze. Worked around
>     it by commenting out insertion_sort and passing it's arguments to
>     quicksort. This shows me that the problem causing mutation testing to
>     break is inside insertion_sort and this will allow me to continue fixing
>     mutation bugs and discover the problem inside insertion_sort method.
>     Used the checklist method.

>     Using the checklist method I went back to the task of achieving 100%
>     coverage. I made a new test case for the pivot method and with the
>     refactored code (for reek) I was able to get 100% coverage. Regardless
>     of this the mutation test is still freezing for me when all methods are
>     uncommented and there does not seem to be many resources troubleshooting
>     this issue online. I am now going to proceed with asking another student
>     if they encountered this problem to not waste any more time.

>     to have less mutatable senarios.

>     In order to eliminiate the last line that was causing alive mutations i
>     decided to try and optimaze the choose_pivot method by rewriting it in a
>     more explicit way. I did reduce my alive mutations to only 3 by doing
>     this but i broke one of my test cases. When the array to sort is big,
>     the sort is not correct. I ran out of time but next time i will fix this
>     test case and then have almost no alive mutations
