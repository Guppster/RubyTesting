>     Using the checklist mechanism in this block of time i improved the
>     coverage of the test suite by another 10 percent. I have continued
>     making use of my FakeIO class and tested input and output for the
>     humanMakeMove method. Currently i am attempting to traverse the program
>     in another order using IO testing to cover more lines

>     Using the checklist mechanism i targetting the next biggest methods of
>     code that were not covered by the tests. These were the autoPlay methods
>     including computer_player_smart, computer_player_dumb, and
>     autoComputerMakeMove. Therefore, I ran a simulated game in the test and
>     checked return values from the getters. Using this I was able to get to
>     80% coverage with my current test suite. This is another 10% improvement
>     from my last update

>     Next thing in my checklist was covering the display method and the few
>     remaining program flows that hadn't been traversed. In this time block i
>     mananged to do that and achive near full coverage. I am at 90% with all
>     IO tested and all logic tested. The remaining 10% is the __FILE__ method
>     which is only executed when the script is run directly therefore it is
>     not easily testable. Since that method is just running other methods
>     (which are tested) in order, it does not have a big impact.

>     In this time slot I fixed my feature file. I discovered i initially
>     copied the feature file from the sample directory incorrectly and
>     therefore i was always seeing cucumber produce 0 scenarios 0 steps as
>     output. To fix this I copied over the sample again and looked up the
>     correct format. From this I was able to get cucumber running

>     In this time segment i learned how to include my code file (gcd.rb) in

>     into the input of another which can be done by making use of instance
>     variables. In the process of learning this I have completed all step
>     definitions and finished Step 3.

>     All tests pass now
