>     Next thing on checklist is convert minitest to rspec. This commit starts
>     and finishes that task. Had to look at rspec documentation to learn
>     about how to use the before block in the specification. I needed to use
>     it to create a new nim instance for each test. It replaces the setup
>     method in the minitest version of the testing file

>     Started Step 3 on the checklist. Generated a coverage statistic and as
>     the instructions described, not much was covered by the tests. Next I
>     researched using the provided links about how to test I/O and began
>     writing an example game with I/O handling. I used the NimPlayerTesting
>     script that was included in the project repo to base my test off of.
>     Test is not complete at this time but is in good progress. Also fixed
>     reek errors in all code provided including the NimPlayerTesting script

>     Still working on Step 3. Have improved coverage and learned a lot more

>     Finished Step 3. Got input and output testing working. Improved coverage
>     by including stdout output lines. Had to write some more additions to
>     the fakeIO class to get everything working. Learned about ruby shortcuts
>     like %w() for returning a word array. Learned ruby doesnt support
>     overloading methods. Now moving on to step 4 on checklist, achieving
